# Udacity-DAND-explore-weather-trends

Exploring Weather Trends :  Project details
this project is the first project in the Udacity data analyst nanodegree .

Summary :
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

my goal was be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city where I live. To do this, I followed the steps below:

* Extract the data from a database. I exported the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where I live. there is a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. 
- Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
* Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
- Open up the CSV in Google sheets .
- Create a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures and plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable .
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.

“How do the changes in my city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

my project is a PDF that includes:

- An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as tools used for each step (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
* How did I calculate the moving average?
- What were my key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
- Line chart with local and global temperature trends.
- At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends.
